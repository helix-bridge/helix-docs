# Overview

XToken BAAS(Bridge as a Service) offers professional cross-chain token mapping bridge services tailored for cryptocurrency token issuance projects or custodial applications. Clients maintain full control over contracts and asset permissions.

Helixbox provides an asset mapping issuance platform, with the asset custody entity being a third-party issuer. Helixbox focuses solely on ensuring the security of the protocol and engineering implementation. The protocol is based on the CBA model and supports transaction integrity.

Any third-party project can use the Helixbox platform to choose the source chain and target chain, create asset locking and mapping contracts, and have complete control over the contract permissions. Third parties can pay to choose the services provided by Helixbox or can deploy and maintain the services themselves using the open-source protocol.
