Helix Bridge is a fully open-source and decentralised cross-chain asset bridge. Based on the common messaging bridge that already exists between chains, Helix provides users with secure, fast, and low-cost asset cross-chain functionality.

## Features
- **Secure**
<br>Helix Bridge separates the underlying generic messages and focuses on the Asset Bridge Protocol portion, where the security of the Asset Bridge is not entirely dependent on the generic messages. Even though we place great importance on security being careful when choosing a generic messaging bridge, the Asset Bridge Protocol minimises the risk when a security incident occurs on the Asset Bridge. Later in the protocol section, we will focus on how Helix secures the user's assets.
- **Fast**
<br>Helix's Asset Cross-Chain Protocol, also known as Cross-Chain Asset Exchange Protocol, crosses the chain at a speed that is even less than the confirmation time of the block on the source chain. Typically, the entire cross-chain process can be completed in 10 seconds to a minute.
- **Low Cost**
<br>Although Helix relies on a common messaging bridge, in most normal scenarios, cross-chaining can be accomplished without the use of common messaging, with simple interactions between the user and the contract, and the transfer of assets occurs directly between EOA accounts, making it very inexpensive.
- **Trustless**
<br>The protocol itself is a decentralised exchange of benefits without the need to trust any centralised system. We have introduced a variety of roles to ensure the safety of user assets and the stable operation of the cross-chain.
