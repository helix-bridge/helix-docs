# Overview

Helixbox LnBridge provides users with a cross-chain order flow entry point, allowing them to simply specify their intent — which token they want to transfer and from which chain to which other chain — without needing to worry about the specific process. The rest is handled by the Solver. Helixbox offers this Solver service, which not only provides sufficient liquidity to meet order flow demands but also completes the final on-chain interactions.

The Helixbox Solver serves not only Helixbox LnBridge but also a variety of on-chain order flows, acting as a Solver for platforms like Cowswap and UniswapX. By aggregating both on-chain and off-chain liquidity strategies, Helixbox provides users with a high-quality, low-slippage experience. Additionally, the Helixbox Solver plays a role in price discovery, liquidity balancing, and MEV (Miner Extractable Value) resistance in multi-chain liquidity trading markets. It also captures service fees and arbitrage profits within the liquidity markets.
